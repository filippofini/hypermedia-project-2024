## Usability Evaulation Review

This [_report_](https://github.com/filippofini/hypermedia-project-2024/blob/c485735530e3f373cb22bebca15c00d3d2fdeb62/Usability%20Project/Usabilty%20Report.pdf) shows the usability evaluation of the website [_unicef.org_](https://www.unicef.org/).\

## Web Technology Project

This is our website: [**Helping Hands**](https://hypermedia-project-2024.vercel.app/).\
The purpose of the Web Technology Project is the development of a website for a non-profit organization that helps women victim of violence. A Chatbot that helps navigating the website and gives informations on violence and basic support is also included.\
Errors or the website not loading, are probably caused by the free database host service of [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) that deactivates itself after 1 week of disuse.\
If the chatbot is not working, it probably run out of credit or has been deactivated. Contact [Fini Filippo](https://github.com/filippofini) if you would like to test it.
